# N Queens

The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing N non-attacking queens on an N×N chessboard. We are going to write a program that solves the N queens problem.

## Requirements

```bash
Usage: nqueens N
```
1. If the user called the program with the wrong number of arguments, print Usage: nqueens N, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4
2. If N is not an integer, print N must be a number, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
3. If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at least 4, followed by a new line, and exit with the status 1
4. The program should print every possible solution to the problem
5. One solution per line
6. You don’t have to print the solutions in a specific order
7. You are only allowed to import the sys module
