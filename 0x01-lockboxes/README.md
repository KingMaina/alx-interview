# LockBox problem

## Problem

You are given a list of lockboxes, n. Each lockbox is numbered sequentially from 0 to n - 1 and each lockbox may contain keys to other lockboxes. Write a method that determines if all the lockboxes can be opened.

## Concepts Needed

### Lists and List Manipulation:

Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
[Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html)


### Graph Theory Basics:

Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.

### Algorithmic Complexity:

Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.

### Recursion:

Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.

### Queue and Stack:

Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.

### Set Operations:

Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.
